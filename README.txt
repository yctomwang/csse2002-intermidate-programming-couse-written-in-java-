assignment three of this coding course
where we have to build ontop of A1 and A2 for a mini minecraft game ;)
select this course at caution if you DO NOT having CODING background
YOU CAN RUN THE RISK OF FAILING..... as this course requires a lot of Java string I/O
read from files, write to files, string manipulation etc.
Also the minecraft game requires you to know the basics of searching BFS or DFS
DONOT SELECT THIS COURSE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CODING BACKGROUND...
anyways its a hell of a ride with decent reward....
